# Data Storage Workflow

When designing a data storage solution, follow these key steps:

## 1. What kind of thing are we storing?

Identify the primary entity or object that needs to be stored. This could be user profiles, product information, transaction records, or any other business entity.

## 2. What properties does this thing have?

List all the attributes and characteristics that describe your entity. Consider both required and optional properties, as well as relationships to other entities.

## 3. What type of data does each of those properties contain?

Define the data type for each property:
- **Text/String** - names, descriptions, addresses
- **Numbers** - integers, decimals, currency
- **Dates/Times** - timestamps, deadlines, schedules  
- **Boolean** - true/false flags, status indicators
- **Arrays/Lists** - multiple values, tags, categories
- **Objects** - nested data structures, complex relationships
